    "# Python :\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction :\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.\n",
    "+ Python is designed to be highly readable\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Interpreted :\n",
    "   \n",
    "+ Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Interactive :\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Object-Oriented :\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of Python :\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Easy-to-Learn :** Python has few keywords, simple strecture and clearly defined syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Easy-to-Read :** Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes\n",
    "+ **Easy-to-maintain :** Python source code is easy to maintain\n",
    "+ **Standard Library :** Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows\n",
    "+ **Interactive Mode :** Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code\n",
    "+ **Portable :** Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reserved Key Words in Python ?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **and :** It's used for comparing two values/ given two conditions are ture\n",
    "+ **assert :**\n",
    "+ **break :** It's used to break the statement\n",
    "+ **class :**\n",
    "+ **continue :** \n",
    "+ **def :** Defining the functions\n",
    "+ **del :** Delete the data using **del** single variable or multiple variables\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Ex :** del a / del a,b\n",
    "+ **elif :** Else if condition\n",
    "+ **else :** Else condition\n",
    "+ **except :**\n",
    "+ **exec :**\n",
    "+ **finally :**\n",
    "+ **for :** It's a loop\n",
    "+ **from :**\n",
    "+ **global :**\n",
    "+ **if :** If condition\n",
    "+ **in :**\n",
    "+ **is :** \n",
    "+ **lambda :** A lambda operator or lambda function is used for creating small, one-time, anonymous function objects in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "    A lambda operator can have any number of arguments but can have only one expression. It cannot contain any statements and returns a function object which can be assigned to any variable\n",
    "+ **not :** \n",
    "+ **or :** \n",
    "+ **pass :**\n",
    "+ **print :**\n",
    "+ **raise :**\n",
    "+ **return :**\n",
    "+ **try :**\n",
    "+ **while :**\n",
    "+ **with :**\n",
    "+ **yield :** We should use yield when we want to iterate over a sequence, but donâ€™t want to store the entire sequence in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Variable & Type of variables ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Assignment :** a=10, b=100.2, c='Rajesh'1.\n",
    "2. **Multiple Assignment :** a=b=c=5, a,b,c=2,2.5,'rajesh'\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Data Types :\n",
    "\n",
    "   + Numbers\n",
    "   + String (str)\n",
    "   + List\n",
    "   + Tupple\n",
    "   + Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is List ?\n",
    "\n",
    "  +  List is an ordered sequence of items. All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Ex :** a=[1,2.2,'Rajesh']\n",
    "  \n",
    "### What is Tupple ?\n",
    "\n",
    "  + It is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets\n",
    "       **or**\n",
    "   + Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list.The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ****Ex :**** \n",
    "thistuple = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\n",
    "print(thistuple)\n",
